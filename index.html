          I was at the coffee shop when I overheard a team expressing an
          appalling situation of a paid remote developer having to elope without
          a proper delivery of the job assigned to him, leaving no trace behind.
          This act had cost the company a lot and were about launching into
          series of courts cases and debts. <br />
          This does not have to be your experience as an employer if you could
          get adequate information on your remote programmers and a system that
          measures their productivity. <br />
